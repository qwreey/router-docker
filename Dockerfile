# router - the network-boundary container for code-docker. Phase 2 of
# egress-netgate-plan.md's outbound lockdown started this as "netgate"
# (RFC1918/CIDR FORWARD filtering, inbound port-forwarding DNAT, a
# best-effort DNS-level content blocklist via dnsmasq); functional-router-plan.md is the
# vision doc that expands its role to also own tailscale (daemon+forwards+
# publish), the Dev Proxy Caddy instance, and a tinyauth forward-auth, while
# code-docker-netinit/dind's own routing loops keep pointing their default
# route at this container the same way they always have (see
# netinit/script/netinit-entrypoint.sh, code-dind/script/dind-entrypoint.sh -
# both resolve the `router` alias, formerly `netgate`).
#
# Own subtree with its own Dockerfile/build context (router/) rather than a
# stage in the root Dockerfile - see functional-router-plan.md's "router
# 서브트리/빌드 구조" - so this container's growing feature set doesn't have
# to keep threading COPY paths back through the repo root, and so it reads
# as a genuinely separate, reusable component rather than one more stage
# among code-docker's own. It has meaningfully higher trust than code-docker
# (dind-authz's "네가 상대적으로 더 신뢰된 컨테이너다" framing applies here
# too), so its own packages/config shouldn't be reachable from inside
# code-docker at all.
#
# Built supervisord-based from the start (not a single monolithic
# entrypoint script) even though it only ran two programs originally, so
# tailscale/Dev-Proxy/tinyauth (see .claude/backlog/functional-router-plan.md)
# can each drop in their own [program:...] section without a rewrite - same
# idiom as the main image's own config/supervisord.default.conf, see root
# CLAUDE.md's "process model". config/supervisord.d/*.conf (this stage's own
# git-tracked built-in program definitions, one file per feature area) is
# what makes that possible - see config/netgate/supervisord.default.conf's
# own comment on the two include globs.

# noVNC, for the VNC tab's BackendRFB targets - router serves the viewer

# (backend/handlers_vnc.go's handleVncSocket), so a target only has to speak
# RFB, the same thing a native client connects to. No websockify here: that
# bridge is Go, in router-manager, which is what makes the viewer
# first-party (same origin as the SPA, gated by router-manager's own lock)
# instead of a user-registered app behind App Routes. See
# backend/internal/vnc's package doc comment for the full reasoning.

# noVNC hardening: never ask the server for a 0x0 desktop. With remote
# resizing on (noVNC's `resize=remote`, the VNC tab's default) noVNC
# forwards its own viewport size to the server as an RFB SetDesktopSize
# request with no lower bound of its own - and a viewer laid out at 0x0 (an
# iframe hidden with display:none, a page that never got a layout pass)
# duly requests 0x0. A wlroots-based server (wayvnc) then passes that
# through as a wlr-output-management custom mode, wlroots rejects any mode
# with width/height <= 0 as a *protocol error*, and libwayland treats a
# protocol error as fatal - so the VNC server dies, and against a target
# that shuts down when its VNC server dies plus a client that auto-
# reconnects, that becomes a restart loop. Observed for real against
# roblox-studio-docker, which carried this same patch on its own vendored
# copy; with the viewer living here instead, one copy of it covers every
# target rather than each target needing its own.
#
# A sed rather than a vendored patch file because it's one line and has to
