// Package targetguard holds the security-critical core of "is this a safe
// reverse-proxy target" validation shared by internal/devproxy and
// internal/approutes — both let a user point a route at an arbitrary
// host:port, so both need the same never-opt-outable self-SSRF block. Kept
// as a single shared copy specifically because SelfHosts is the kind of
// list someone patches once (a new self-referential alias, say) and easily
// forgets to patch twice — see router/.claude/router-nginx-hardening-plan.md,
// Finding 1, for the original incident this guards against (a Dev Proxy
// route that could reach Caddy's own admin API).
